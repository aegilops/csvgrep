# csvgrep
Read in a CSV, dump any lines that match (or don't match) the provided regex on the line (or on the specified column).  Allows grepping a CSV that has multiline fields, which is not supported by raw grep.

Unrelated to the existing [`csvgrep`](https://csvkit-cypreess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/examining_the_data.html#searching-for-rows-with-csvgrep) that is part of the Python module `csvkit`
